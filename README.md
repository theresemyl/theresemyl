# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm Therese, a newbie developer and committed lifelong learner. While I'm still in the beginning of my journey, I'm documenting my growth and progression here on GitHub for all to see!

### Recently, I've been proud of these moments...
- Creating my first full-stack application called PlaceMatch

### Next up, I'm looking to learn...
- A lot more about databases! 
- To deploy my first project
